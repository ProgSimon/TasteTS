# TasteTS

TasteTS is an internet application that allows users to create, share, and review recipes.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Purpose

TasteTS is a portfolio project created to demonstrate my skills in full-stack TypeScript development.

## Documentation

The documentation is split into two parts:

- **Development docs** - a very detailed, step by step record of the whole development process. It lets the reader dive into the creator's decision-making process and follow every major change in the code.  
The maintenance period is currently indefinite. Meant mainly for recruiters.

- **Project docs** - brief, and to-the-point documentation of the whole project. Just docs as they should be.

**TL;DR**  
- Development docs - record of decisions and progress  
- Project docs - clean project documentation
